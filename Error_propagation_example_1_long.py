Monte Carlo Error Propagation Example 1
    This code takes some data with Gaussian uncertainties and propagates them
    through a function.

    Both output means with standard deviation uncertainties and medians with
        with 68.3% coverage uncertainties are estimated.
    If the mean and standard deviation and median ; if the two methods give
        inconsistent results, then the output results do not have Gaussian
        uncertainties.
